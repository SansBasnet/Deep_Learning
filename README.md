# Deep Learning and Neural Network applications 


Each folder on this repo contains a different Deep Learning and Neural Network project. It contains the primmary code, dataset (for most ones or the link to the dataset) and for some results and README.md for instructions. 

- Perceptrons 
- Artificial Neural Network
  - Neurons
  - Weights
  - Biases
  - Activation functions (most used ones) 
- Back prop and Hyperparameters
- Convolutional Neural Network
- Natural Language Processing
- LSTM and Recurrent Neural Network
