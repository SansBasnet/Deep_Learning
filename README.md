# Deep Learning and Neural Network applications 


Each folder on this repo contains different Deep Learning projects. It includes the primmary code, dataset (for most ones or the link to the dataset) and for some results and README.md for instructions. 

- Perceptrons 
- Artificial Neural Network
  - Neurons
  - Weights
  - Biases
  - Activation functions (most used ones) 
- Back prop and Hyperparameters
- Convolutional Neural Network
- Natural Language Processing
- LSTM and Recurrent Neural Network
